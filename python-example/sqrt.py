"""
This script implements the Newton-Raphson method for finding square roots. 
The function `sqrt(n, approx=None)` takes a number `n` and an optional initial approximation `approx`. 
If no initial approximation is provided, it uses `n / 2.0`.

The function works by repeatedly improving the approximation according to the formula `(approx + n / approx) / 2.0`. 
This process continues until the new approximation is the same as the old one (to within a very small margin of error), 
at which point the function returns the approximation.

In Python, the equality comparison better == approx will be true when the difference between better and approx is less than a very small number (around 1e-9 for float numbers).
This is due to the way floating point numbers are represented in computer memory, which can only maintain a certain level of precision.

Here's an example of how the computation progresses for `sqrt(26.0)` and `sqrt(25.0)`:

sqrt(26.0):
-----------------
Initial approximation: 13.0
Better approximation: 7.46153846154
Better approximation: 5.40602696273
Final approximation: 5.09901951359

sqrt(25.0):
-----------------
Initial approximation: 12.5
Better approximation: 7.25
Better approximation: 5.34913793103
Better approximation: 5.01139410653
Better approximation: 5.00002317825
Better approximation: 5.00000000005
Final approximation: 5.0

def sqrt(n, approx=None):
    # If this is the first call, initialize approx to n/2.0
    if approx is None:
        approx = n / 2.0

    # Calculate a better approximation
    better = (approx + n / approx) / 2.0

    # Base case: if the new approximation is the same as the old one, we're done
    if better == approx:
        return approx

    # Recursive case: if not, call the function again with the new approximation
    return sqrt(n, better)
