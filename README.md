# Squared-root-Newton-method
 Demostration of Newton's squared root algorithm in different languages

 The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative algorithm that starts with an initial guess
 for the square root and then repeatedly improves that guess until it is good enough.
 The improvement step involves averaging the current guess with the number divided by the guess.
